🔍 Description
AmanaMeal is a role-based QR code food claim management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled with TailwindCSS. The name "Amana" (Arabic: أمانة) means trust, symbolizing the integrity and fairness in food distribution this platform upholds.

The system streamlines and secures meal disbursement at events, camps, or community centers by ensuring that:

Every user category (Male, Female, Guest) is accurately tracked.

Admins set rules for food claiming, control QR code lifespans, and manage non-admin members.

Sub-categories like Ansarullah, Atfal, Lajna, Nasirat are enforced to avoid misuse.

Each user has a unique membership ID; duplicate registrations are disallowed.

Only valid, non-expired QR codes generated by the system are honored.

All access and claim rules are visually managed from a dynamic dashboard.

🔑 Key Definitions
User: Everyone except Admin and Non-admin (i.e., users = general participants).

Admin: Acts as the Coordinator with control over non-admin users.

Non-admin: Members under admin control (i.e., Male, Female, Guest categories).

📋 Categories & Subcategories
Category	Subcategories
Male	Atfal, Khuddam, Ansarullah
Female	Nasirat, Lajna
Guest	None

🖥️ Dashboard (on Page Load)
Upon visiting the site, users are shown a dashboard displaying:

Admin

Male

Female

Guest

👨‍💼 Admin Features
Set Claim Limits: Define how many times each category can claim food.

QR Code Lifespan: Set expiry time for QR codes generated for non-admins.

QR Code Monitor: Track number of QR codes created by each user (limit to 2 max).

User Cleanup: Remove duplicate or suspicious entries.

Meal Time Setting: Set when meals should be dished.

🧍 Non-admins (Male, Female, Guest)
On Click (e.g., Male):

Validate QR codes:

❌ Expired QR code – not accepted

❌ Fake/External QR code – not accepted

❌ Valid QR code from another category – not accepted
