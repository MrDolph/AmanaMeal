🔍 Description
AmanaMeal is a role-based QR code food claim management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled with TailwindCSS. The name "Amana" (Arabic: أمانة) means trust, symbolizing the integrity and fairness in food distribution this platform upholds.

The system streamlines and secures meal disbursement at events, camps, or community centers by ensuring that:

Every user category (Male, Female, Guest) is accurately tracked.

Admins set rules for food claiming, control QR code lifespans, and manage non-admin members.

Sub-categories like Ansarullah, Atfal, Lajna, Nasirat are enforced to avoid misuse.

Each user has a unique membership ID; duplicate registrations are disallowed.

Only valid, non-expired QR codes generated by the system are honored.

All access and claim rules are visually managed from a dynamic dashboard.
